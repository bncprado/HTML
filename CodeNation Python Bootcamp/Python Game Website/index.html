So, are you ready to embark on this exciting adventure and discover the secrets hidden within the forest? The clock is ticking, and time is running out. The fate of the donkey rests in your hands!</p><br>
                        
                    <p> Pick between multiple directions and consider your next steps. Will you find the donkey on time?
                        If you choose to travel North, you are given a directive to follow THE MUDDY FOOT PATH. 
                        The path is slippery and treacherous, but you push forward, hoping to find clues that will lead you to the donkey.
                        As you make your way through the forest, you encounter Snakes, some friendly and some foes. They give you random clues that might lead you to the CAVES, 
                        or continue along THE MUDDY FOOT PATH towards the SWAMP. You take in the information and make quick decisions, hoping to find the donkey before time runs out.
                        Before reaching the SWAMP, you find Blood on the ground, which could be a clue that leads you to the CAVE where the donkey is found, 
                        or to the SWAMP where you meet Ogre who tells you that it's a dead end due to flesh-eating fish. You weigh your options and decide to take your chances and go to the CAVE.</p><br>

                    <p>If you choose to travel South, you are given a directive to follow THE ROCKY FOOT PATH. 
                        You find Footprints, which could lead you to the SWAMP, the FARM, or continue along THE ROCKY FOOT PATH that leads to FIND THE DONKEY AND WIN THE GAME. 
                        Further along THE ROCKY FOOT PATH, you might meet Bates, who could be a friend or foe, and if you continue, you'll find the CAVES where the donkey is located.</p><br>

                    <p>Choosing to travel West, you are given a directive to follow THE DANGEROUS OBSTACLE PATH. 
                        This path is full of dangers, including Poisonous Spiders, who might attack and kill you or not attack at all. 
                        You might also encounter the Horse, who could be a friend or a foe. As you push forward, you find Blood on the ground, which could lead you to the CAVE where the donkey is found, or to the TAVERN in the KINGDOM.
                        If you continue, you'll find the donkey's rug, which could lead you to the FARM or to meet the Farmer, who might give you more information.</p><br> 

                    <p>Finally, choosing to travel East, you follow the GRASS & MEADOWS PATH. Here, you might meet Rabbit, who could tell you that the donkey is eating hay or tell you to continue along the path. 
                        You might also encounter Birds, who could tell you to look in the CAVES for the donkey or continue along the GRASS & MEADOWS PATH. Eventually, you reach the TAVERN in the KINGDOM, 
                        but if you want to find the donkey, you must return to the beginning and choose a different direction.
                        With a time limit of 5 minutes and various paths and potential outcomes, Ogre's Quest: In Search of Donkey offers an exciting and replayable adventure through a mysterious forest filled with both friendly and dangerous creatures. 
                        As the player, you must make quick decisions based on the clues you find and the random outcomes that occur. Will you find the donkey and win the game, or will you be forced to start again and try a different path? The choice is yours!

                    <li>We used the "Live Share" extension on VSC so everybody could code and see what changes others were
                        doing.
                        We were able to collaborate smoothly, which was very useful.</li><br>
                    <li>One of the team members had a good knowledge of coding and this allowed the team to be more
                        efficient.</li><br>
                    <li>Interaction between team members went really well and everyone actively contributed when

                <ul>
                    <li>We would split the work load better and delegate more or less functions to each member of the team.</li><br>
                    <li>Involve every members of the team in writing of the code, which would allow us to understand it
                        better.</li><br>
